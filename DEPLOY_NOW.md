# 🚨 DEPLOY SECURECLAW NOW - EXACT STEPS

## THE PROBLEM

Your Replit is running OLD code. The new features are on GitHub but not deployed.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION - COPY THESE EXACT COMMANDS

### Open Replit Shell and run these ONE BY ONE:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

```bash
git checkout cursor/assistant-autonomy-and-optimization-9f3b
```

```bash
git pull origin cursor/assistant-autonomy-and-optimization-9f3b
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
pkill -f "server:dev" || true
```

```bash
npm run server:dev
```

---

## 🔍 YOU SHOULD SEE THIS IN LOGS:

```
[Permissions] 📂 Permission system ready
[Integrations] 🔗 App linking available
[Credits] 💳 Credit system initialized
[Monitor] 🏥 Health monitoring active
[Wiki] 📚 Help system loaded
express server serving on port 5000
```

If you see these, **IT WORKED!**

---

## 🧪 TEST IMMEDIATELY

In iOS app, send:

```
"Monitor server status"
```

You should get:
```
✅ Gateway: Healthy
✅ Grok AI: Healthy
✅ Browser: Available
✅ Permissions: Operational
```

---

## ❌ IF IT DOESN'T WORK

Check you're on the right branch:

```bash
git branch
```

Should show:
```
* cursor/assistant-autonomy-and-optimization-9f3b
```

If not, you're on wrong branch. Run:
```bash
git checkout cursor/assistant-autonomy-and-optimization-9f3b
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL

**You MUST pull the code from GitHub first!**

Without pulling, you have OLD code without:
- ❌ Browser automation
- ❌ App integrations
- ❌ Monitoring
- ❌ Help system
- ❌ AGI improvements

**Branch**: `cursor/assistant-autonomy-and-optimization-9f3b`

**This is THE ONLY BRANCH with all features!**
